        <h2>Why I got into SAIT</h2>
        <p> I was in my gap year to find a that program I wanted to get into, I wanted to use my creative and artistic style and be in a field with lots of opportunities. Finding out that SAIT made a new IDD program I was very interested and started to look into what a web designer and developers do, and soon realized this was the program I wanted to get into!</p>
